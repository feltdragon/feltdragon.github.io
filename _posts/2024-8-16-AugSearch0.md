---Can you find three rabbits, an elephant, an easter egg, and a knight? The walls of the room are papered with magnetic chalkboard film. Magnets stick to it but it is not magnetic itself. I meant this to be an ordinary search and find but my four year old sister came in and helped me. Eventually we populated the whole top of the dresser with toys and random items.
