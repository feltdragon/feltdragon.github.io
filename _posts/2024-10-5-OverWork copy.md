I started school last month. My school is a homeschool school hybrid, which means I don’t go to school on certain days of the week. In this case I stay home Monday and Friday. Just because I stay home those days does not mean I have a lot of free time. The work is more demanding than that of the private school I went to last year. This is all to say I have not been able to put up the search and finds, Like I normally do. I am sorry. Also I would like to write more real blog posts like this one. The search and finds’ real job was for me to have something to blog about every month. One day I’m going to post the solutions, but that probably won’t be soon.
