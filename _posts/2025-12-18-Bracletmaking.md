  Whether you would like to be more proactive about sending carepackages or hoping this year or hoping this is the year you finally send out the Christmas letter on time, these tips will help you become better at sending things by snail mail.

1 Have the supplies and know where you keep them. 
It is quite annoying to have to delay sending a package because you can not find a scale. Ensure you know where everything is located. 

2 Streamline the process. 
Do you have one pen pal to whom you'd like to write more often? Pre-addressed a stack of envelopes with their name and address. 

3 Don’t know what to say? Cheat. 
Cards and letters are not school assignments with a required word count and type size. If you only have a few things to say, just find a small card and write big. Just the fact that you are sending it through the mail means a lot these days.
